# calchart-studio
Replacement for the existing CalChart editor with improved functionality to expedite the charting of field shows, make charting more approachable, and improve user experience.

Let's face it, CalChart is too far gone. It's built on a shaky codebase that no one knows how to work on maintained almost entirely by alumni.
CalChart Studio, unlike CalChart Viewer 3D, is an experiment that may bear no fruit. But I'm willing to give it my best shot.
